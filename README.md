# GVINS_Recorder
This is a hybrid mobile app to record GPS, Visual and Inertial sensor data.

The app framework used here is Apache Cordova and the app itself is developed using web technologies (HTML5, CSS, JS). The aim is to provide a way to record sensor measurements for developing sensor fusion algorithms using a mobile phone with a common system clock (i.e. asynchronous sensor fusion).
